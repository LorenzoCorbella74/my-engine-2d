# PIXI Engine

Super basic 2d Engine based on [pixijs](https://pixijs.com/), Typescript and Webpack. Just provide in the folder `game` a list of scenes included in the file `Config.ts`. 

All the `.png` and `.jpeg` images, .mp3` sounds and `.json` files included in the folder `assets` will be loaded before the game starts and available during gameplay.  

## TODO
- Sound manager
- Scene manager
- Time Manager and Scheduler
